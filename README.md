DFXML
=====

Welcome to the original home of the Digital Forensics XML (DFXML) source code repository.

This repository formerly housed support for two language families: C/C++, and Python.  To track independent versioning and CI systems for the two languages, and to move DFXML towards a model to more clearly encourage community involvement, the repository has been split into two.

* C/C++ code is now tracked at this repository: [`https://github.com/dfxml-working-group/dfxml_cpp`](https://github.com/dfxml-working-group/dfxml_cpp).
* Python code is now tracked at this repository: [`https://github.com/dfxml-working-group/dfxml_python`](https://github.com/dfxml-working-group/dfxml_python).

Due to unexpected issues with Github features, Github Issues that were filed on this repository will need to remain here.  Please note that further Issues should be filed at their respective repository hosted by the ["dfxml-working-group" Github organization](https://github.com/dfxml-working-group/).
